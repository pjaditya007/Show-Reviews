# Privacy Policy

**Don't worry, we don't collect a thing!**

This privacy policy ("Policy") applies to the Chrome extension "Show Reviews" (the "Extension") developed by Jai Aditya.

We understand the importance of user privacy, and that's why we built this extension to be completely transparent about data collection.

## In short:

- We don't collect any personal information from users.
- We don't access your browsing activity, viewing habits, or anything else on Netflix, Prime Video, or other websites.
- We don't track or transmit any user data.
- We don't share any information with third parties.

## Long story short (still short):

This extension is all about helping you find the best movies to binge, not about collecting data on you. Relax, grab some popcorn, and enjoy!

## Changes to this Policy

We may update this Policy occasionally to reflect any changes or legal requirements. We'll keep it clear and concise, and you'll always find the latest version here.

## Questions? We've got answers!

If you have any questions about this Policy, feel free to reach out to us at jaiaditya98@gmail.com.
